## GaelFórsa - A Predictive Maintenance Platform

GaelFórsa is an advanced predictive maintenance platform designed to help industries monitor and maintain their equipment efficiently. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, machine learning, and data analytics, GaelFórsa provides real-time insights into equipment health, enabling proactive maintenance strategies that reduce downtime and extend asset lifespan.

It seeks to provide a Graphics-based User Interface (GUI) for ease of use and accessibility, to manage the state of various offshore wind turbines.
It collects information from various sensors installed on the turbines, such as temperature, vibration, and pressure sensors. 

It then compares these against a list of ideal factors in order to determine the health of the turbine, and current severity.
A stretch goal is to use weather conditions to determine the ideal time to send maintenance crews.

****

Below is a list of the parameters we want to collect to support our system:

**On-turbine parameters:**

- Rotor speed
- Power output
- Generator temperature
- Gearbox oil temperature & pressure
- Vibration levels
- Blade pitch angle (Angle of the blades against the wind so it catches the most wind)
- Yaw position & error (Turbine's position relative to the wind)

**Weather parameters:**

- Wind speed & direction
- Wave height & how long that wave takes to get done
- Water temperature
- Air temperature & humidity
- Lightning strikes

**Grid parameters:**

- Voltage & current at multiple points in the turbine, like at the top vs. the bottom
- AC Power Factor
- Cable temperature (subsea and internal)
- Grid connection status
- Tower tilt/inclination to read foundation integrity
- Corrosion sensors maybe to examine salt water exposure impact
- Foundation scour depth simmilar to the tower tilt thing but its just to measure seabed erosion around base
- Blade condition via acoustic sensors or cameras for ice/damage
